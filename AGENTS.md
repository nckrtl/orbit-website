# Launch Starter Kit

Laravel 13 + Launch Laravel + React 19 + Inertia v3 + VitePlus + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn

## Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 13, Launch Laravel, PHP 8.4+
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript 7
- **SPA bridge**: Inertia.js v3 with SSR
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with `tw-animate-css` and `shadcn/tailwind.css`
- **Components**: shadcn base-nova components backed by Base UI (`@base-ui/react`)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Toolchain**: VitePlus (Vite 8 + Oxc linting/formatting)
- **Vite config**: `defineLaunchConfig()` from `@nckrtl/launch-ui/vite`

The kit depends on `nckrtl/launch-laravel` from Packagist. To develop against a local checkout, use `composer link ../../packages/launch-laravel` after `composer install` — see "Working on the kit itself" in README.md, which is the source of truth for this workflow. `composer link` keeps `composer.json` and `composer.lock` untouched; `composer unlink <path>` restores the published package.

## Agent Skills

Use the stack-specific skills whenever their domain is involved:

- Laravel PHP: `laravel-best-practices`
- Pest unit, feature, or browser tests: `pest-testing`
- Waymaker controller routes: `waymaker-development`
- Wayfinder frontend route functions: `wayfinder-development`
- React and Inertia: `vercel-react-best-practices` and
  `inertia-react-development` together
- shadcn/Base UI components: `shadcn`
- Tailwind styling: `tailwindcss-development`
- VitePlus commands or configuration: `vite-plus`

When React and Inertia guidance overlap:

- Inertia owns page data, navigation, forms, validation errors, deferred and
  merged props, polling, prefetching, history state, and SSR. Prefer its APIs
  and Wayfinder-generated actions over client fetch effects or hardcoded URLs.
- Apply the generic React skill's portable rendering, effects, bundle, and
  browser-performance guidance. Ignore its Next.js, React Server Component,
  Server Action, `React.cache`, `after()`, and SWR-specific rules.
- Do not add dependencies such as SWR or `better-all` solely to follow a generic
  example. Use Laravel, Inertia, React, and VitePlus-native mechanisms first.
- SSR is enabled. Keep server and browser renders deterministic, keep browser
  APIs out of server render paths, and preserve the starter kit's
  `createInertiaApp()` and VitePlus SSR setup.
- Use version-specific documentation before applying framework APIs.

## Vite Configuration

`vite.config.ts` uses `defineLaunchConfig()` which bundles all plugins:

```ts
import { defineLaunchConfig } from "@nckrtl/launch-ui/vite";
export default await defineLaunchConfig();
```

This configures: laravel-vite-plugin, @inertiajs/vite (with SSR), @vitejs/plugin-react, @tailwindcss/vite, @laravel/vite-plugin-wayfinder, and artisan runners for waymaker + typescript:transform.

### Options

```ts
export default await defineLaunchConfig({
    i18n: true, // Enable i18n (see below)
    i18n: { locale: "nl", fallbackLocale: "en" }, // With options
    react: { babel: { plugins: ["..."] } }, // Pass-through to @vitejs/plugin-react
    wayfinder: { formVariants: true }, // Pass-through to wayfinder
    inertia: false, // Disable @inertiajs/vite
    plugins: [myPlugin()], // Additional Vite plugins
    lint: { options: { typeAware: true } }, // VitePlus lint config
});
```

## Internationalization (i18n)

Enable in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
export default await defineLaunchConfig({ i18n: true });
```

This auto-loads translation files from `lang/*.json` and injects `initI18n()` into the app entry point. No providers or wrappers needed.

### Translation files

```
lang/
  en.json     # {"Hello :name": "Hello :name", "Home": "Home"}
  nl.json     # {"Hello :name": "Hallo :name", "Home": "Thuis"}
```

### Usage in components

Use `__()` — a plain function import matching Laravel's Blade `__()` helper:

```tsx
import { __ } from "@nckrtl/launch-ui/i18n";

function MyComponent() {
    return <p>{__("Hello :name", { name: "Nick" })}</p>;
}
```

Supports `:placeholder`, `:Placeholder` (ucfirst), and `:PLACEHOLDER` (uppercase) replacements.

### Language switching

```tsx
import { __, useLocale, setLocale } from "@nckrtl/launch-ui/i18n";

function LanguageSwitcher() {
    const locale = useLocale(); // reactive — triggers re-render on change
    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setLocale("en")}>EN</button>
            <button onClick={() => setLocale("nl")}>NL</button>
            <p>{__("Home")}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

`setLocale()` hot-swaps all translated strings instantly, persists to localStorage and cookie.

## Routing

- **Waymaker** (`nckrtl/waymaker`): attribute-based PHP routing. Controllers use `#[Get]`, `#[Post]`, etc. attributes instead of route files. Routes are registered via `Waymaker::routes()` in `routes/web.php`.
- **Wayfinder** (`laravel/wayfinder` + `@laravel/vite-plugin-wayfinder`): auto-generates TypeScript route helpers at build time. Import from `@/actions/` for type-safe URLs.

## Component Registry

`components.json` configured with:

- Style: `base-nova` (shadcn components backed by Base UI primitives, not Radix)
- Icon library: `lucide`
- `@launch` registry for layout components

```bash
bunx shadcn add button dialog              # shadcn components backed by Base UI primitives
bunx shadcn add @launch/app-sidebar-layout # Layout from the @launch registry
```

lang/                     # Translation JSON files (when i18n enabled)
```

## Development

```bash
composer dev              # Server, queue, logs, and vite — only when nothing else serves the app
vp dev                    # VitePlus dev server only
bun run build             # Production build: vp build && vp build --ssr
vp build                  # Client build only (no SSR bundle)
vp check                  # Lint + format (Oxc)
vp check --fix            # Auto-fix
composer test             # Pest tests (Unit + Feature suites) via scripts/run-pest.php:
                          #   full suite until the repo has a first commit, --tia after
composer test:browser     # bun run build, then Pest browser tests (tests/Browser)
composer lint             # Pint (PHP formatting)
composer analyse          # PHPStan level 9
composer rector           # Rector code upgrades
composer check            # test + analyse + vp check + test:browser
composer fix              # rector + lint + vp check --fix
```

Under Herd or Orbit the app is already served — do not run `composer dev` or
`php artisan serve` there. README.md and the environment addenda in
`resources/markdown/environments/` are the source of truth for how the app and
its long-running processes are run per environment.

### SSR

Production SSR is enabled: `bun run build` builds the SSR bundle, and its port
is pinned to 13719 in `vite.config.ts` (no env override exists — read the
comment there before changing it). Feature tests deliberately disable SSR and
Vite (`tests/Pest.php` sets `inertia.ssr.enabled=false` and calls
`withoutVite()`) so they stay deterministic — passing Feature tests therefore
prove nothing about SSR. Do not "fix" tests by re-enabling SSR in them, and do
not treat the test suite as SSR coverage.

## Code Quality

- **PHP**: Pest v5, PHPStan level 9, Pint, Rector
- **Browser tests**: Pest Browser v5 for user-visible UI workflows in `tests/Browser/`.
  Note: `tests/Browser/` is not part of the phpunit.xml testsuites, so `composer test`
  does not run it — run `composer test:browser` (builds assets first) or
  `vendor/bin/pest tests/Browser` against an existing build. The `playwright` npm package
  is already a devDependency (installed by `bun install`), but the Chromium binary is a
  separate one-time install: `bunx playwright install chromium`. Without it, browser
  tests — and therefore `composer check` — fail on a fresh machine
- **JS/TS**: VitePlus (Oxc linting + formatting)
- **Git hooks**: committed `.vite-hooks/` scripts, installed by `vp config` (run
  automatically by `bun install` via the package.json `prepare` script), which points
  `core.hooksPath` at the VitePlus dispatcher. Pre-commit runs `vp staged` (the `staged`
  tasks in `vite.config.ts` against staged files).
  Skip once with `VP_GIT_HOOKS=0`. Do not configure `hook.*` git config keys — nothing reads them
- **CSP**: Spatie laravel-csp with Basic + Development presets

## Feature Completion Gates

Every feature must include automated test coverage before it is reported as done.

- Backend/domain behavior requires focused PHP feature or unit tests.
- Inertia page responses require Inertia assertions for the expected component and props.
- Any user-visible UI workflow requires a Pest Browser test in `tests/Browser/`.
- Any UI-affecting change must also be manually verified in a real browser using the agent's browser tooling (the `agent-browser` CLI/skill or equivalent), including checking browser console errors.
- Completion reports must list the exact tests and browser validation that passed.
- If browser testing or browser validation is skipped, the report must explicitly state why the change has no user-visible UI surface.

## Conventions

- CSS design tokens live in `resources/css/theme.css`, not scattered across component files
- Generated shadcn UI components use `@base-ui/react` primitives. Do not install `@radix-ui/*` packages
- Use Wayfinder-generated imports (`@/actions/...`) for route URLs, never hardcoded strings
- Use `__()` for user-facing strings when i18n is enabled
- Page components live in `resources/js/pages/` and are resolved by Inertia automatically
- `VITE_APP_URL` in `.env` must match the Orbit domain for HTTPS dev server to work
